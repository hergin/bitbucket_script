# Bitbucket Script
I prepared this script to automate repo handling for a class I am a teaching assistant.

It uses bitbucket API v2: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/repository-resource-423626331.html

But an exception made for priviliges API which doesn't exist in v2 but in v1: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/privileges-endpoint-296093145.html

I specifically used bitbucket because it lets me create unlimited private repos for academic account ;)
